<p> Pizza (pepperoni)</p>

<th> Ingredients and quantity

<li> 16 ounces pizza dough, store-bought or homemade </li>

<li> 1/2 cup pizza sauce </li>

<li> 18 to 20 slices pepperoni </li>

<li> 12 ounces mozzarella cheese, grated </li>

<li> 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper </li>

<li> 1 teaspoon fresh oregano, optional </li>

<li>Flour for rolling and shaping dough </li>

</th>

<h2> Step 1: </h2> 

Make the sauce by doing the following steps: 1/2 cup tomato sauce (no salt)

<li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt </li>

<li> 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper </li>

<li> 1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic </li>

<li> 1/2 teaspoon granulated onion </li>

<li> 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes </li>

<li> 1 teaspoon olive oil </li>

<h2> Step 2: </h2>
<p>
Preheat the oven to 500°F:
If you are using a pizza stone, preheat it in the oven for at least 20 minutes so it is nice and hot as well.</p>

<h2> Step 3: </h2>
<p> If you are using my sauce recipe, stir together the ingredients. The sauce recipe makes just enough for one large pizza. You can easily double it if you are making more than one pizza.</p>

<h2> Step 4: </h2>
<p> Roll out the dough:
Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface. If it's hard to roll, let it rest for 5 minutes so it can come to room temperature. For a large pizza, I like to roll my dough into about a 14-inch diameter circle.</p>

<h2> Step 5: </h2> 
<p> Add the toppings:
Transfer the dough to a lightly dusted pizza peel. Alternatively, fit it into a large cast-iron.

Add sauce in a light layer all over the pizza, leaving about 1/4-inch crust around the edges. Chop half of the pepperoni and sprinkle it over the sauce. Top the pizza with grated cheese and the rest of the pepperoni. Season with black pepper.</p>

<h2> Last Step </h2>
<p> Cook the pizza:
If you're using a pizza stone, carefully slide pizza into the center of the preheated pizza stone. Cook for 6 minutes, then rotate the pizza halfway so it cooks evenly. Cook for another 6 to 8 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and charred in spots.

If you're using a skillet, press the dough into a cast iron skillet and add toppings. Place the skillet over a high heat burner for 2 minutes to get it preheated and get the crust cooking right away. Then transfer to a 500 °F oven and bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.</p>

Fresh egg pasta </h2>

<h3> Ingredients and Quantities
<li>2 2/3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling the pasta </li>

<li> 3/4 teaspoon salt </li>

<li>4 large eggs </li>
</h3>

<h2> Step 1:</h2>
<p>
Combine the Flour and Salt: Whisk together the flour and salt with a fork in a large bowl.
Add the Eggs: Create a deep well in the middle of the flour and crack the eggs into this well. Whisk the eggs with the fork to combine.Note: You can do this on the counter-top "Italian Grandmother Style" if you prefer, but I find it's easier and less messy to do it in a bowl. For food-processor instructions, see below.</p>

<h2> Step 2:  </h2>
<p> Begin Combining the Flour and Eggs: As you whisk the eggs, begin gradually pulling in flour from the bottom and sides of the bowl. Don't rush this step. At first, the eggs will start to look like a slurry. Once enough flour has been added, it will start forming a very soft dough. Don't worry if you haven't used all the flour. </p>

<h2> Step 3: </h2>
<p> 
Knead the Pasta Dough: Turn the dough and any excess flour out onto a clean counter. Begin gently folding the dough on itself, flattening, and folding again. It will be extremely soft at first, then gradually start to firm up. Once it's firm enough to knead, begin kneading the dough. Incorporate more flour as needed to prevent the dough from sticking to you or the counter. Slice into the dough with a paring knife; if you see lots of air bubbles, keep kneading. The dough is kneaded when it forms a smooth elastic ball and has very few air bubbles when cut. </p>

<h2> Step 4: </h2>
<p> Rest the Pasta Dough: Clean and dry the mixing bowl. Place the ball of dough inside and cover with a dinner plate or plastic wrap. Rest for at least 30 minutes.Note: At this point, the pasta dough can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours. Let it come back to room temperature before rolling </p>

<h2> Step 5: </h2>
<p> Rest the Pasta Dough: Clean and dry the mixing bowl. Place the ball of dough inside and cover with a dinner plate or plastic wrap. Rest for at least 30 minutes.Note: At this point, the pasta dough can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours. Let it come back to room temperature before rolling </p>

<h2> Step 6: </h2>
    <p> Divide the Pasta Dough: Sprinkle a baking sheet generously with flour and scrape the ball of dough on top (it will stick to the bowl; use a spatula or bowl scraper if necessary). Divide the dough into four equal portions. Dust the portions with flour and cover with a clean dishtowel.Note: The name of the game at this point is to keep everything well-floured to prevent the pasta from sticking to itself or the roller as you work. If the dough starts to feel sticky as you roll it, sprinkle it with flour. Also sprinkle flour on any pasta you're not working (rolled, cut or otherwise) with and keep it covered with a dishtowel. </p>
     
<h2> Step 7: </h2>   
<p>Begin Rolling Out the Pasta: Set your pasta machine to the thickest setting (usually marked "1"). Flatten one piece of dough into a thick disk between your hands and feed it through the pasta roller. Repeat once or twice. Fold this piece of dough into thirds, like folding a letter, and press it between your hands again. With the pasta machine still on the widest setting, feed the pasta crosswise between the rollers (see picture). Feed it through once or twice more until smooth. If desired, repeat this folding step. This helps to strengthen the gluten in the flour, giving it a chewier texture when cooked. </p>

<h2> Step 8:</h2>
<p> Thin the Pasta: Begin changing the settings on your roller to roll the pasta thinner and thinner. Roll the pasta two or three times at each setting, and don't skip settings (the pasta tends to snag and warp if you do). If the pasta gets too long to be manageable, lay it on a cutting board and slice it in half. Roll the pasta as thin as you like to go. For linguine and fettuccine, I normally go to 6 or 7 on the KitchenAid attachement; for angel hair or stuffed pastas, I go one or two settings thinner. </p> 

<h2> Step 9: </h2>
<p> Cut the Pasta: Cut the long stretch of dough into noodle-length sheets, usually about 12-inches. If making filled pasta or lasagna, proceed with shaping. If cutting into noodles, switch from the pasta roller to the noodle cutter, and run the sheet of pasta through the cutter. Toss the noodles with a little flour to keep them from sticking and gather them into a loose basket. Set this basket on the floured baking sheet and cover with a towel while you finish rolling and cutting the rest of the dough.Note: I find it easiest to roll all the pasta at once before proceeding to cutting it into noodles. I sprinkle the sheets of pasta liberally with flour and overlap them on a floured baking sheet, covered with a towel. </p>

<h2> Step 10: </h2>
<p> Cooking, Drying, or Freezing the Pasta: To cook the pasta immediately, bring a large pot of water to a boil, salt the water, and cook the pasta until al dente, 4-5 minutes. To dry, lay the pasta over a clothes drying rack, coat hangers, or the back of a chair, and let air dry until completely brittle. Store in an airtight container for several weeks. To freeze, either freeze flat in long noodles or in the basket-shape on a baking sheet until completely frozen. Gather into an airtight container and freeze for up to three months. Dried and frozen noodles may need an extra minute or two to cook. </p>
